"""aggregator_officer_audit.py — flag OUT-OF-STATE INSTITUTIONAL officers (national servicer / REO
signers) that Splink would otherwise resolve as a single NYC owner, to produce a precision-safe
exclusion-candidate list for human curation.

The aggregator problem also comes through shared OFFICERS, not just shared addresses (F6/F7): a
HeadOfficer name that signs across many buildings owned by DIFFERENT parties is a shared *signer*
(servicer / managing agent), not a beneficial owner — yet Splink merges the name into one
owner-entity. Eric Moore is the canonical case: 210 NYC buildings under one "Eric Moore" head-officer
name, registered from out-of-state corporate offices (Temecula CA / Dallas TX) — a national
SFR/REO signer, not a NYC landlord.

The *obvious* discriminator — owner-of-record DIVERSITY (how many distinct owning LLCs the officer
spans) — **fails**: a real owner running one shell LLC per building looks identical to an aggregator.
Mark Scharfman, a genuine single owner, spans 103 owner-LLCs over 136 buildings (0.76 / building) —
essentially Eric Moore's 194 / 210 (0.92). That is the F6 "mask must not fire on shell-LLC owners"
caveat, in data.

Out-of-state address is necessary but NOT sufficient: at `MIN_BUILDINGS` buildings + `FAR_PCT`
far-state, 8 officers flag, but only 4 are servicers — the other 4 are genuine out-of-state OWNERS (a
Maine LIHTC developer, an RI investor, a NH fund "CCM Ventures", a NC apartment LLC). The distinguishing
signal is the CorporateOwner on their buildings: a mortgage SERVICER / GSE / bank (Fannie Mae, Selene
Finance, Shellpoint, Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Security National Servicing) means REO/foreclosure
holdings the officer merely signs for, not owns. So the rule requires out-of-state (`FAR_PCT`) AND
servicer-owned buildings (`SERVICER_PCT`) — Moore/Ballard/Boudreaux/Johnson flag; the 4 real owners do not.
(Owner-of-record diversity is useless here — a real shell-LLC owner (Scharfman, 103 owner-LLCs / 136
bldgs) matches an aggregator, the F6 caveat.)

Read-only, Postgres-only. `audit()` DECIDES nothing — it emits candidates (option b, the durable rule);
`excluded_officer_names()` returns the hand-verified CURATED allowlist (`CURATED_SERVICER_OFFICERS`,
option a) gated by that rule, and the resolution (`splink_bridge._resolve`) drops exactly those from
`extract()` so their buildings resolve by owner-of-record (registered-llc / deed), not the shared signer.
Doing it at extract-level is essential — it is feedback-proof (a clusterer veto is not: `feedback_merge`
re-merges past it).
