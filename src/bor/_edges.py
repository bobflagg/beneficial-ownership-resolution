"""Shared edge-construction kernel for the identity edge builders.

Every identity-edge source (record-linkage model, curated, registered-LLC, deed) emits, per
resolved group, either a full clique or a bounded hub-and-spoke star, as ``(src, dst, weight)``
rows over ``landlords_with_connections`` nodeids. ``weight`` is uniform — the owner-group layer
takes plain connected components, so edge weights carry no ranking, only presence.

These constants and helper are lifted verbatim from WatchlineNYC's ``portfolio`` pipeline so the
edges BOR builds are byte-identical to the ones that produced the live graph (parity is the
acceptance test). Kept in one place here rather than forked per-module.
