"""bor/operational_network.py — the operational network (v1.1), off-graph.

*What a building operates through* — the shared-infrastructure clustering that is WoW's own
notion of a "portfolio," here rebuilt off Neo4j. It is WCC(+Louvain) over three edge types:

  * NAME    — WoW's fuzzy name self-join (precomputed in lwc.name_match_info), weight ×1.5
  * ADDRESS — WoW's business-address self-join (lwc.bizaddr_match_info), weight ×1.0, with
              aggregator megaoffices (>25 landlords) masked out
  * SPLINK  — the resolved-owner cliques (model ∪ curated ∪ registered-LLC), weight 100

Mirrors WatchlineNYC's Portfolio layer (portfolio/algorithms.py) exactly in structure:

  1. WCC over name ∪ address ∪ splink (unweighted connectivity) — pure union-find, EXACT.
  2. For each component whose BBL-sum exceeds MAX_SIZE (300), recursively split with weighted
     Louvain until each piece fits. This is the ONE non-exact step: WatchlineNYC runs GDS's
     seedless, default-granularity Louvain, which a Python Louvain (igraph) cannot byte-match —
     and which GDS itself does not reproduce run-to-run. It fires only on a tail of a few dozen
     oversized components (large operators like Kadden ~496 BBLs); the vast majority of portfolios
     are ≤300 BBLs, pure WCC, and reproduce exactly. See docs/parity.md.

Off-graph: everything is Postgres (the name/address edges are already materialized as JSON in
`landlords_with_connections`) plus the splink edges this package already builds. No Neo4j.
