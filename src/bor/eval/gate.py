"""eval/wow_gate.py — the hardened WoW veil-pierce gate (evaluation / analysis tooling).

**Not** production. The live graph (`deed_edges.py` / `owner_groups.py` / `pipeline.py`) does not use
this gate; it is the *verification* criterion the deed-review analysis applies to decide whether a
candidate `CONNECTED_BY_DEED` owner group is a **genuine deed veil-pierce** — real JustFix WoW *splits*
the owner across distinct portfolios and only the shared deed reunites them (the AXL case) — versus a
**WoW over-lump**, where WoW already groups most of the buildings via a shared aggregator/back-office
address, so the deed "recovers" nothing WoW hadn't already merged (Citadel, and the soft-aggregator
bridge cases OG-10150 / OG-33260).

## The failure this hardens (see specs/deed-gate-review.md §6)

The old gate asked: do the group's member BBLs land in ≥2 distinct real `wow.wow_portfolios`, *none an
aggregator lump* — where "aggregator" was a **hard cutoff: a WoW portfolio with > 25 distinct
landlords**. That cliff is too loose. A 121-building / 16-landlord portfolio is plainly an over-lump,
but 16 < 25, so the hard cutoff called it "not an aggregator" and passed the candidate. Verified
2026-09-19: all five bridge linked-successor candidates wrongly PASSED, the tell being the two with
scale — OG-10150 (35 of 37 buildings already in one 121/16 WoW portfolio) and OG-33260 (5 of 10 in one
102/11 portfolio).

## The two complementary checks (either failing → the candidate is NOT a clean veil-pierce)

1. **Graded soft-aggregator detection** — replaces the hard > 25-landlord cliff. A portfolio is an
   aggregator if it clears the hard address-level landlord threshold (kept at
   `aggregator_audit.MIN_DEGREE` = 25 as the default) *or* is a **soft aggregator**: large *and*
   multi-landlord (`>= SOFT_MIN_BUILDINGS` buildings and `>= SOFT_MIN_LANDLORDS` landlords), which
   recognizes an over-lump well below 25 landlords. Members landing in *any* aggregator portfolio fail
   the "≥2 distinct, none an aggregator" test.

2. **Dominant-portfolio-share check** — a threshold-*independent* backstop. Fail when a **majority**
   (`>= DOMINANT_SHARE`) of the candidate's member buildings already sit in **one** WoW portfolio that
   is itself large / multi-landlord (i.e. aggregator-ish). This asks the right question directly —
   "does WoW already group most of these?" — and catches both soft-aggregator cases regardless of the
   exact landlord threshold. A genuine split (AXL) is *distributed across comparable small portfolios*,
   so its dominant portfolio is small and this check does not fire.

The gate PASSES only when the members span ≥2 distinct WoW portfolios, none of which is an aggregator,
and no single large/multi-landlord portfolio holds a dominant share.

Design note — why the *portfolio proxy*, not the raw address degree. The truly primitive signal is the
degree of the business address WoW merged on (`aggregator_audit.py` classifies that on the discovery
graph). But `wow.wow_portfolios` exposes only `(orig_id, bbls, landlord_names)` — not the merge
address — so joining the address primitive to a WoW portfolio is not available from the WoW dump alone.
The graded landlord-count / buildings-per-landlord proxy is computed directly from the dump, is exactly
what the regression fixtures key on, and is tuned so every fixture resolves correctly. `MIN_DEGREE` is
imported so the hard landlord default stays a single source of truth with the address-level classifier.

Pure core (`is_aggregator_portfolio`, `wow_gate`) is import-only and unit-tested with fixtures rebuilt
from the regression table. `portfolio_placements` / `gate_bbls` are the thin, read-only Postgres
loaders for real use against `wow.wow_portfolios` (integration-only; need `PG*`).
