-- landlords_with_connections — the WoW landlord graph table, built from wow_landlords.
--
-- VENDORED VERBATIM from JustFix's Who Owns What
--   who-owns-what/portfoliograph/sql/landlords_with_connections.sql
-- (only the trailing read-only `SELECT * FROM landlords_with_connections` was dropped —
-- that statement exists purely so WoW's graph.py can stream the result set; we materialize
-- the table instead). Kept byte-faithful otherwise so nodeids/edge weights match WoW's.
--
-- BOR builds this itself (bor.build_lwc) so it needs only the DATA — the JustFix `wow_landlords`
-- dump — not any WatchlineNYC pipeline. Source table `wow_landlords` is one contact per
-- (bbl, registration) with a standardized business address. We self-join it to build the
-- connections (edges) between distinct (name, bizaddr) contacts (nodes), keyed by a generated
-- `nodeid`, and weight each edge by our confidence — later consumed by the WCC + Louvain split
-- (bor.operational_network). In justfixwow both the source and this output live in the `wow`
-- schema (the connecting user's schema is first on search_path), so the unqualified names below
-- resolve there. See docs/data.md.
