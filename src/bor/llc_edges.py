"""CONNECTED_BY_SPLINK edges from the DOF-registered owner entity (the same-LLC signal).

A deterministic ownership signal the head-officer nexus structurally misses. WoW's
``landlords_with_connections`` links landlords by the registered **head officer** (a
person); it never links on the property's **DOF owner-of-record**. So two buildings owned
by the *same registered entity* — e.g. BEACH 99TH LLC on two lots — land in different
portfolios whenever their head officers differ. This module reads
``pluto_latest.ownername`` (the DOF owner) and, for every entity owning >=2 buildings,
emits a weight-100 clique between those buildings' landlord nodes so WCC+Louvain merge them.

**Same legal entity name == same owner, definitionally** — so this is precision-1 by
construction for a genuine owner entity, with no probabilistic model and no ACRIS pipeline.
Two guards drop the only things that break that identity:

  * generic / placeholder owner strings (blank, "UNAVAILABLE OWNER", "SEE …"), and
  * institutional owners (HDFC, NYCHA, City, authorities) that are not private single-owner
    entities — the same exclusions the ownership analysis used.

A degree cap (``DEFAULT_MAX_DEGREE``) additionally skips any name on an implausibly large
number of lots — a placeholder or a title-holding nominee used across unrelated owners —
mirroring the aggregator-address mask on the linkage side.

Measured (2026-08, wow DB): **447 owner entities span >=2 portfolios over 1,307 buildings** —
a cheap, deterministic ownership signal, larger and cleaner than the ACRIS deed signal's
*current* incremental coverage. See the ownership-layer decision memo (specs/).

Neo4j-free: returns ``(src_nodeid, dst_nodeid, weight)`` over lwc nodeids so ``pipeline.py``
loads it exactly like the model and curated edges (with ``method=LLC_METHOD``).
