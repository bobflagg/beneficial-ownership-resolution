"""Curated same-owner overrides — human-verified merges the resolution can't reach.

Mechanism B leaves a residual the model *cannot* close: an operator's records that
share only an EXACT, RARE full name — different management shell, different office,
**no shared corp and no shared address** — form a separate connected component, so
WCC never joins them and the operator shows as >1 portfolio. Threshold 0.999 plus the
corp-feedback loop can't bridge these: there is no address or corp signal, only the
name, and the model was trained (on the stratified same-name slice) to distrust name
similarity precisely so it never fuses two different people who share a name.

Concrete case (verified 2026-08): Steven Croman's main 126-bbl portfolio registers
under CENTENNIAL PROPERTIES NY; a 9-bbl remnant registers under ROCKSOLID
PM/MANAGEMENT/VENTURES with **zero** co-registration to Centennial. Only the rare
exact name "STEVEN CROMAN" ties them — a human judgement the resolver can't make.

This module is the human-in-the-loop backstop: a small, hand-verified table of "these
landlord nodes are the same real owner." Each entry force-emits a weight-100
``CONNECTED_BY_SPLINK`` clique between the matching ``landlords_with_connections``
nodes, so the existing WCC+Louvain merges them exactly as it would a model-derived
clique. Edges only ADD → this can only MERGE fragments, never split a portfolio.

**PRECISION IS A HUMAN'S RESPONSIBILITY HERE.** Add an entry only after verifying the
records are the same person (ownership docs, a shared principal, corroborating public
record) — NOT merely because two nodes share a name. Populate it from the ranked
candidates surfaced by ``propose_merges.py`` and record the verifying evidence in each
entry's ``evidence`` field.

Provenance: curated edges carry ``method=CURATED_METHOD`` so they are distinguishable
from model-derived ``splink-fellegi-sunter`` edges in the graph. All seed entries merge
within one surname, so ``verify_splink``'s "0 cross-surname edges" invariant still holds;
if you ever add a cross-surname entry (e.g. a maiden/married name), whitelist curated
edges in that check.
