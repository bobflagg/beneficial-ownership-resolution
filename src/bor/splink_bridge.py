"""CONNECTED_BY_SPLINK — feed Splink's owner resolution into WoW's portfolio graph.

Mechanism B (see CLAUDE.md "Splink as a de-dup edge"). Splink resolves raw HPD owner
contacts into precision-first entities; this emits a high-weight edge between every pair
of ``landlords_with_connections`` nodes that resolve to the *same* owner. The pipeline's
WCC+Louvain then merges the fragments WoW's name/address matching split — Croman's typo'd
offices collapse from 6 portfolios into 1 — WITHOUT changing anything WoW already links:
edges only ADD, so connected components can only *merge*, never split. An existing
portfolio (e.g. an agent-linked shell operation) is therefore safe by construction.

This module is Neo4j-free: it runs off Postgres + Splink and returns
``(src_nodeid, dst_nodeid, weight)`` so ``pipeline.py`` can MATCH the ``Actor`` nodes by
``ACT-LL-<nodeid>`` and MERGE the relationships (mirroring the name/address edge load).

Node mapping is EXACT, not fuzzy. A Splink contact and an lwc node both carry the same
``(owner name, bbl)`` from the same HPD registration, so an explode-and-join on
``(name, bbl)`` maps each lwc node to its Splink entity — 99.9% of lwc nodes covered in
the production run, with zero edges linking different surnames (the name-anchored
resolution + first-name/common-name vetoes guarantee that).

Runs against whatever ``PGDATABASE`` points at; in production that is the ``wow`` DB, so
Splink reads ``wow.hpd_contacts`` and the join reads ``wow.landlords_with_connections``.
