"""Frozen regression targets, validated against the reference `justfixwow` dump and the live
WatchlineNYC knowledge graph (see docs/parity.md).

All counts are checked with a tolerance. Splink-dependent counts jitter ~0.05% run-to-run
(u-sampling over DuckDB). The deed layer has no Splink but is still not bit-exact: ACRIS
latest-deed tiebreaks and data vintage move a handful of edges (observed 941 and 935).
