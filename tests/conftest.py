"""Shared fixtures. Integration fixtures need a Postgres (the JustFix `justfixwow` dump with lwc
built); without `PGDATABASE` set they skip, so a plain `pytest` runs the unit tests offline.

The resolutions are expensive (~4 min of Splink each), so they are session-scoped and reused
across the integration tests.
