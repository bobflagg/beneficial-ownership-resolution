# Evaluation Protocol — Beneficial-Ownership Resolution (minimal viable)

**Goal.** Measure, against adjudicated ground truth, whether WatchlineNYC's ownership
resolution (a) correctly merges an owner's differently-named LLCs without over-merging, and
(b) correctly splits owners that WoW fuses via shared management addresses — and quantify the
delta vs. WoW's clustering. Designed for one collaborator-pair, ~600 pairs, ~2 weeks.

**As-of date.** Fix a snapshot date `D`. Both systems' decisions and all adjudication evidence
are evaluated as of `D`. Freeze strata, sampling frame, codebook, and metrics *before*
adjudicating (lightweight preregistration; note it in the paper).

---

## 1. Unit & labels

**Unit:** the pairwise decision — *"are landlord entities X and Y the same beneficial owner?"*
Each entity is a `(name, standardized business address)` identity node (a cluster of such nodes in the
cutover frame), drawn from WoW's per-BBL owner/officer contact selection — the `name` is always a
responsible *person*, not necessarily a head officer and never a managing agent or bare corporation
name. See [`review-tool-contract.md`](review-tool-contract.md) §1 ("What an entity is (provenance)").
**Labels:** `SAME` · `DIFFERENT` · `INDETERMINATE`. Indeterminate is a first-class outcome
(public record often can't settle ownership); excluded from precision/recall denominators and
reported separately as **coverage**.

Every `SAME` also carries a **corroboration class**, assigned at scoring from the recorded evidence
and the system's signal (see §3):
- **C1 — cross-source corroborated**: rests on ≥1 source *other than* the record the system keyed on.
- **C2 — same-source verified**: rests only on the primary record the system's signal used, with all
  three mandatory checks (§3) passed.

Precision is reported **both ways** — strict (C1 only) and inclusive (C1+C2); the gap discloses how
much of a result stands on single-source (typically deed-only) evidence.

## 2. Strata & sampling (~600 pairs)

Uniform sampling is useless (≈all random pairs are trivial non-matches). Sample where decisions
and errors live. Draw each stratum by simple random sample from its frame; record the frame size.

| # | Stratum | Frame (pairs, as of `D`) | n |
|---|---------|--------------------------|---|
| S1 | **Deed merges** | linked (incl.) by `CONNECTED_BY_DEED` | 150 |
| S2 | **Model merges** | linked by `CONNECTED_BY_SPLINK` method `splink-fellegi-sunter` | 150 |
| S3 | **Aggregator splits** | share a masked aggregator business address, placed in **different** OwnerGroups | 150 |
| S4 | **Hard negatives** | same surname **or** same address, **not** merged | 150 |

**Recall anchors (not sampled):** a fixed set of operators with *externally documented, complete*
portfolios (e.g. Croman via the AG settlement, plus named portfolios from enforcement actions /
investigative reporting). Used only for recall (§4).

## 3. Annotator codebook

**Golden rule — what counts as evidence.** The system's *output* (a `CONNECTED_BY_DEED` edge, an
OwnerGroup assignment, any "match" flag) is **never** evidence. Only **primary records** are — ACRIS
deeds, NYS DOS filings, HPD registrations, court/enforcement records. The tool presents *all* primary
records for both entities and never highlights "the match," and the annotator is **blind** to the
system's signal (§4), so they reconstruct the picture independently.

**Evidence hierarchy** (record the highest tier reached + a one-line rationale):

- **T1** — ACRIS deed grantee identity / documented conveyance chain (incl. grantor-chain restructuring).
- **T2** — NYS DOS entity filing: shared CEO / process / registered-agent principal. *Thin in
  practice — `ceoname` is populated for ~11% of LLCs, the process name is usually the entity itself,
  and DOS is active-only (dissolved shells absent). "No DOS match" ≠ "no such entity."*
- **T3** — shared principal across independent filings (HPD registration, mortgage, court).
- **T4** — external record: AG/DOF settlement, court judgment, named-portfolio reporting, JustFix data.
- **Insufficient** — address-only, name-only, or nothing but the system's own output.

**Decision rules.**
- `DIFFERENT` ⇐ positive evidence of *distinct* ownership (distinct grantees / distinct principals /
  no linking conveyance).
- `SAME` ⇐ co-ownership verified from primary records, recorded as **C1** (a corroboration from a
  source *other than* the record the system keyed on) or **C2** (only the same primary-record type the
  system's signal used — permitted **only** behind the hard gate below).
- else `INDETERMINATE`.

**Circularity ruling.** Circularity is *not* "used the same signal" — it is "used the system's
*output*, or confirmed a match the adjudicator could not have overturned." Verifying the same primary
*record* the system keyed on is allowed, because the adjudicator checks inputs the heuristic cannot
and can reject the pair — but only as **C2**, and only when **all three** mandatory checks pass
(recorded as checkboxes; no C2 `SAME` without all three):

1. **Entity identity** — the linking party is the *same* entity across the deeds, not a
   normalized-name collision (confirm via DOS record / consistent address, not the name string alone).
2. **Successor reality** — each successor LLC is genuinely single-purpose (pull *its own* full ACRIS
   history), not an independent portfolio the system's size proxy under-counted.
3. **Restructuring vs. sale** — the onward conveyance reads as the grantee restructuring its own
   holdings (nominal/related-party transfer; timing/attorney pattern), not an arms-length sale.

If any check fails or cannot be made, the pair is `INDETERMINATE`, not `SAME`. Rationale for the
ruling: the fully-obscured veil-pierce cases — the system's most valuable output — show *nothing* in
DOS/HPD by design, so a rule that demanded cross-source corroboration for every `SAME` could never
confirm them; C2 credits them, the hard gate keeps them honest, and §5's strict number quarantines
them for skeptics.

**Worked validation — check 3 catches a partition between partners (CUT-0006, adjudication).** A 2010
deed (`2010041200399001`, $2.73M) co-conveyed an entity-A building (`4161860058`) and an entity-B
building (`4161880066`) to one LLC, `BEACH FAR ROCKAWAY PARTNERS LLC` — a textbook co-conveyance bridge
between the two node groups (`URI DREIFUS` / `SAM FARBER`). But in 2015 that same LLC (grantor on both)
split them into per-building successors — `4161860058` → `BEACH 114TH PARTNERS LLC` (sole head officer
**Dreifus**), `4161880066` → `BEACH 116TH PARTNERS LLC` (sole head officer **Farber**), for real money
($1.1M / $2.7M). So it reads through the checks as: **entity identity** — one identifiable grantee, but a
*two-person partnership*; **successor reality** — both successors are single-purpose ✅; **restructuring
vs. sale** — ❌, the split **partitioned the joint asset between two different partners** (each took one
building into his own sole LLC), a division between distinct parties, not one owner reorganizing shells it
still controls. Check 3 fails → a deed-only `SAME` is recorded `INDETERMINATE`, and the substantive call
is `DIFFERENT`: Dreifus and Farber are distinct people whose *former* co-ownership (an **association**, not
identity — Option B / R3) has dissolved into separate current ownership; the shared office
(207 Rockaway Turnpike) is an association signal, not identity. This is the mirror of a *valid*
linked-successor case — e.g. `AXL HOME LLC` bought two adjacent Flushing houses (43-58 & 43-60 164th St)
on one 2015 deed (`2015120200784001`, $1.2M) and in 2019 re-deeded each into its own single-purpose shell
**at $0** — 43-58 → `BRIDGEWOOD DEVELOPMENT LLC`, 43-60 → `HONG LI GROUP LLC`. They register to two
different people at two different addresses, so **real JustFix WoW splits them into two unrelated
portfolios** (`wow.wow_portfolios` `orig_id` 14133 vs 55695); the shared deed is the *sole* tie and the
group (`OG-15928`) is wired by `CONNECTED_BY_DEED` **only**. The grantor-chain and single-purpose
successors look identical to the partition/sale above, and **check 3 is the sole discriminator** —
same-owner restructuring at nominal consideration (recover as `SAME`) vs. partition or sale between
parties at real prices (reject). (Verify positive examples against `wow.wow_portfolios`, not the graph's
own `Portfolio` nodes — see [`case-axl.md`](case-axl.md), incl. why the vivid 15-shell Citadel fleet is
*not* such an example: WoW over-lumps it via a shared aggregator address.)

The gate works as designed.

### 3.1 Shared owner-of-record: coverage triages, the C2 gate decides

A shared **current owner of record** (the latest-deed grantee — or PLUTO `ownername` where the latest deed
confirms it, never where it contradicts it) on *both* sides is the panel's strongest same-owner signal — but
"shared" is not "same owner" until you read **how much of each side it covers**. Coverage is the
operationalization of *the* owner vs *an* owner:

- **Incidental** — a minority share on either side (CUT-0028: `HOMES FOR THE HOMELESS INSTITUTE, INC.` at
  **1/33 ↔ 1/11**). Two entities that each merely *contain* a building some third party owns are not thereby
  the same owner. → `DIFFERENT` on this signal (still weigh any other link).
- **Dominant-both** — the plurality/majority current owner of record on *both* sides: only here is the shared
  owner *the* owner of both portfolios → a **candidate** `SAME`, routed through the C2 hard gate (§3).
- **Asymmetric** (dominant one side, a sliver the other) — *not* `SAME`: side A *is* that owner; side B merely
  holds one of their buildings.

**First, one owning *entity* on both sides — not two co-principals sharing a *person*.** Before coverage even
applies, confirm the shared owner of record is a *single legal entity appearing on both sides*, not two
distinct owning entities linked only by a shared individual. The two look alike and adjudicate opposite:

- **Same owning entity on both sides → `SAME`** (identity of the owner). CUT-0029: `212-214 REALTY CO. LLC` is
  the current owner of record on a building in *each* node; the two adjacent lots carry *identical* ownership —
  same LLC, same manager (Sackman Enterprises), same principals (Alan Sackman, James Hefelfinger, Carter
  Sackman) — and split into the person-anchored nodes `ALAN SACKMAN` vs `JAMES HEFELFINGER` **only because the
  HPD HeadOfficer slot alternated between the two partners of that one LLC.** A single owning entity on both
  sides is `SAME`; that its members are two distinct people is a red herring (every family partnership has ≥2
  principals). This is a person-anchoring recall miss — the `registered-llc` signal that would recover it is
  R3-excluded from identity (F1/F4).
- **Two distinct owning entities linked by a shared person → `DIFFERENT`** (association / common control).
  CUT-0006: Dreifus and Farber's former joint LLC *partitioned* into two **separate sole LLCs** (Beach 114th /
  Beach 116th); the current owners of record are distinct entities, bridged only by the two men's prior
  co-investment and a shared office. Co-owners / co-officers / shared-agent linking *distinct* owning entities
  is association (Option B / R3) → `DIFFERENT`.

The discriminator is **the owner-of-record entity, not the people**: is the *same* LLC/corp the current
grantee on both sides (→ `SAME`), or do the two sides hold title in *different* entities that merely share a
principal or an office (→ `DIFFERENT`)? Coverage then applies to the former case — a single shared owning
entity — to separate *the* owner from an incidental one.

**Coverage is a triage band, never the criterion — do not set a bright-line percentage as the ownership
test.** A fixed cutoff fails four ways, each visible in CUT-0028:

1. **The denominator is the entity under test.** Coverage = shared-owner buildings / *this entity's building
   count*, and that count is the resolution being adjudicated. Thresholding a ratio whose denominator is the
   defendant is quietly circular.
2. **Small N breaks the percentage.** `2/3` reads "67%" on three buildings; ownership is not more true because
   a portfolio is small. Under ~5 buildings a side, read the records, not the ratio.
3. **It cannot see the institutional/umbrella confound.** 73% coverage is identical whether the shared owner
   is one real operator or a nonprofit/HDFC **sponsor** holding title over operationally-distinct buildings
   (phase-2 findings F5). The number can't separate them; the nature of the owner can.
4. **It discards corroboration.** A dominant shared owner-of-record *also* backed by a shared head officer or
   business address is a far safer `SAME` than one standing alone; collapsing to a scalar throws that away.

**The decision instrument is the existing C2 gate, not a number.** A high-coverage shared owner-of-record is a
same-source (ACRIS / PLUTO) claim, so a `SAME` on it is **C2** and takes the three mandatory checks of §3
(entity identity / successor reality / restructuring-vs-sale) **plus** an institutional/umbrella read: is this
a genuine common owner, or a sponsor/pass-through whose shared title is an *association* across distinct
operators (Option B / R3)? An institutional-dominated owner (F5) does not by itself defeat `SAME`, but the
merged thing is then "same owner *of record*," which may not be the accountability grouping — flag it; and a
pure umbrella with **no other** shared identity signal is `INDETERMINATE`, not `SAME`.

**Why this is not a threshold in disguise.** "Dominant/plurality" is deliberately a band the annotator reads
*with* the corroborating records, and the binding decision is the gate — the same discipline every other
`SAME` gets. The band only decides whether a pair is worth gating; it never stands in for the gate. Coverage
tells you where to look; the primary records and the three checks decide what you found. *(Panel support for
reading currency and per-side coverage on this line — "current &lt;date&gt; $&lt;amt&gt;" and the PLUTO-vs-deed
caveat — is owner-review `e6d5e8c`; see phase-2 findings F11.)*

### 3.2 Worked examples — both name *and* business address differ (accuracy frame)

A node is keyed on `(name, standardized business address)`, so any two distinct nodes differ in ≥1 of
those; the **both-differ** case is where WoW's name+address matching cannot help and the primary records
decide. Two real frame pairs — both adjudicate `DIFFERENT`, but for opposite reasons, and each is a
**false-merge hazard** the deed/name signals can walk into (BBLs abbreviated; the tool surfaces the records
from them):

**`P0133` (S1b deed) → `DIFFERENT` — the restructuring-vs-sale trap (`registered-llc`/deed over-recovery).**
A `OSMAN ALI` @ *434 Leland Ave, Bronx* (lots 21/23/25/26) vs B `LONGCHENG NI` @ *3078 Coddington Ave, Bronx*
(lot 22) — different person, different office. ACRIS deed `2013120600683001` (2013-08-09) conveyed an
**8-lot block-3498 assemblage** (lots 19–26) to one grantee, `LELAND PROPERTY LLC` (grantor Amjad Ali). **But
in 2025 that assemblage was broken up in genuine arms-length sales**: lot 22 → `NI, LONGCHENG` ($1.1M, deed
`2025111100447002`), lot 20 → `SONG, GONG LIANG` ($1.1M), lot 24 → `LIN'S DOUBLE WOOD LLC` ($1.15M), lot 19 →
`427 SOUNDVIEW LLC` (2022); only lots 21/23/25/26 remain `LELAND PROPERTY LLC`. So the current owners of
record are **distinct** → **`DIFFERENT`** (§3.1: PLUTO/latest-deed contradicts the 2013 deed).
<br>Why this is a *method* trap, not a stale-data one: the held-since rule alone correctly drops the sold lots,
but `deed_edges.py`'s **linked-successor guard re-merges them** — it re-includes any parcel whose latest-deed
grantor is the joint grantee (`LELAND PROPERTY LLC`) and whose buyer owns ≤ `SUCCESSOR_MAX`(3) buildings, with
**no consideration/price check**. All three 2025 buyers pass (each owns ≤3 buildings), so a *fresh* rebuild on
current ACRIS still produces the over-merge. The guard cannot tell a **$1.1M arms-length sale** from a **$0
restructuring into a controlled shell** — which is exactly §3's *restructuring vs. sale* (check 3), a **manual
adjudication gate** the automated edge builder does not implement. (**Fixed** in `deed_edges.py` commit
`5f51475` — re-inclusion now requires nominal consideration (`docamount <= NOMINAL_MAX`); the deed edges +
OwnerGroup layer were rebuilt, and OG-42728 is now correctly split (Osman/Osmani Ali retained; Ni and Song
dropped to their own owners). Retained here as a worked example of the failure mode and the C2 gate.)

**`P0464` (S4 hard-neg) → `DIFFERENT` — the shared-surname trap.** A `EZRA ADJMI` @ *Long Branch NJ*
(a Brooklyn building) vs B `ROBERT ADJMI` @ *1412 Broadway, Manhattan* (a Manhattan building) — a
**shared, prominent surname** that tempts a merge. But the owners of record are distinct — A held
personally by `ADJMI, EZRA` + `ADJMI, JACK` (2021 deed, $1.35M); B owned by `J T TAI & CO INC` (Robert
Adjmi is only the HPD contact) — and across A's 22 and B's 13 ACRIS documents there are **zero shared
deeds**. Distinct grantees, no linking conveyance → `DIFFERENT`, tier **T1**. A common surname is not
ownership.

Together they are the two **false-merge** hazards the merge-side strata (S1, S2) exist to measure:
`P0133` — **linked-successor over-recovery**, an arms-length sale to a small buyer misread as a
restructuring into a controlled shell (the deed builder lacks the consideration check that §3's
restructuring-vs-sale gate applies); `P0464` — a **tempting shared surname** with no ownership link. For
the mirror (a *valid* both-differ `SAME`, where one owning entity really does sit on both sides), see the
CUT-0029 case in §3.1.

## 4. Annotation process

- **2 annotators**, independent, **blind** to which system (WatchlineNYC / WoW) produced any
  decision and blind to the driving signal.
- **Every pair captures**: label, highest evidence tier, a one-line rationale, and — for any `SAME`
  whose only corroboration is the deed record — the **three C2 checkboxes** (§3). The tool enforces
  the hard gate: a deed-only `SAME` missing any checkbox is recorded as `INDETERMINATE`. The system's
  signal is *not* shown; class C1/C2 is assigned at scoring by rejoining the blinding key.
- Report **inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's κ)**; target κ ≥ 0.70, else diagnose the stratum.
- **Third-party adjudication** (or documented consensus) resolves disagreements → the gold label.

## 5. Metrics

Compute per stratum; report **Wilson 95% CIs** on all proportions.

- **Precision (S1, S2)** among system-merged pairs, reported **two ways** (see §1 corroboration
  classes): **strict** = `C1 / (C1 + DIFFERENT)`, **inclusive** = `(C1+C2) / (C1+C2 + DIFFERENT)`.
  `INDETERMINATE` excluded from the denominator. Also report **coverage** = `1 − INDETERMINATE/n` and
  the **C2 share** of confirmed SAMEs (the strict↔inclusive gap) — expect it large on S1 (deed),
  small on S2 (model).
- **Split precision (S3)** = `DIFFERENT / (SAME + DIFFERENT)` (a correct split = the pair really is
  two different owners).
- **False-merge rate (S4)** = `SAME / adjudicable` (guards against vetoes/mask over-firing —
  should be low; these were *not* merged, so `SAME` here = a recall miss, not a precision error).
- **Recall (anchors only)** = recovered true same-owner pairs / all true pairs within each
  documented portfolio. Full-population recall is **not** claimed; say so.
- *(optional)* **B³ precision/recall** on the anchor portfolios for cluster-shape quality.

## 6. Head-to-head vs. WoW

- Run **both** systems' merge/split decision on the **same** adjudicated pairs (blind).
- Paired data on identical items ⇒ significance by **McNemar's test** on the discordant pairs
  (where the two systems disagree and the gold label breaks the tie). Report on S2 + S3.
- **Headline table:** Precision / Split-precision / Recall-proxy / F1 for WoW vs. WatchlineNYC,
  overall and on the disagreement strata, with CIs and McNemar *p*.

## 7. Controls & error analysis

- **Data-vintage control.** Any system disagreement traceable to a record present in one snapshot
  but absent in the other (cf. the 333 Rector / "Dianna Lam" confound) is bucketed as **DATA**, not
  **METHOD**, and excluded from method precision/recall. Report the two buckets separately.
- **Error taxonomy.** Tag every gold error (false `SAME` / false `DIFFERENT`) with a cause:
  `common-name` · `stale-deed` · `aggregator-leak` · `missing-filing` · `genuine-ambiguity`.
  This figure is the contribution, not just the number.

## 8. Preregistered decision rules (fix these before adjudication)

Fixing the rules before any data is seen is what turns the head-to-head from a demo into evidence.
Folded from [`ownership-model-spec.md`](ownership-model-spec.md) §9. Bracketed values are defaults to
**fix with the team / co-adjudicator before adjudication**, not post hoc.

- **Primary metric:** strict precision (C1-only) on system-merged pairs (S1+S2); inclusive is secondary.
  The strict number is the claim; the strict↔inclusive gap (C2 share) is reported, not buried.
- **INDETERMINATE in the headline:** reported *as* coverage (`1 − INDET/n`) beside every precision
  figure, never silently dropped. A stratum with coverage `< [0.70]` is reported **inconclusive**, not
  scored.
- **Reviewer-agreement gate:** κ `≥ [0.60]` on the double-adjudicated subset. Below it, revise the
  codebook and re-adjudicate that stratum *before* reporting any metric.
- **Blinding of mechanism:** adjudicators see **records only** — blind to both the system's decision and
  the linking mechanism. Per-mechanism precision/recall (`registered-llc` / `acris-deed` /
  `fellegi-sunter` / `curated`) is computed **post hoc** by rejoining the private key, so mechanism
  knowledge can't bias a label.
- **Independent ground truth:** a SAME is C1 only if corroborated by ≥2 **independent primary sources**
  (§1); the system's own output is never evidence.
- **Recall proxy (name which):** recall is reported only against the **curated anchor portfolios**
  (documented owners) as an explicit proxy — full-population recall is undefined for unknown
  common-control and is **not** claimed. Optionally add discovery-yield among known cases.
- **Sampling weights:** strata are fixed-n, not proportional; per-stratum numbers are primary, and any
  pooled/population estimate must **reweight by stratum prevalence**.
- **Go / no-go for the method claim (design-paper level):** WatchlineNYC strict precision `≥` WoW
  precision on the disagreement strata, McNemar `p < 0.05`, with false-merge rate (S4) `≤ [bar]`.
  Failing that, report the honest negative.
- **Stopping / rollback:** if *severe* false-attribution — a false SAME implicating a **living person**
  or bridging groups whose combined size `> [T]` — exceeds `[rate]` in any stratum, that mechanism is
  pulled from the merged set pending fix, and the fact is reported, not hidden.

**Launch thresholds are staged and stricter (deferred).** The bars above validate the *method* for a
design paper. *Public attribution* requires the separate, consequence-tiered thresholds in
[`ownership-model-spec.md`](ownership-model-spec.md) §8/§10 — set per rollout stage (research < beta <
public) — which this minimal eval does not establish.

### 8.1 Identity-resolution cutover thresholds (gate the Option B Phase-5 cutover)

The Phase-5 identity cutover gate is preregistered and frozen (run manifest pins this section's revision
hash) **before Phase-2 results are seen**. `[RATIFY]` = a value the team fixes at sign-off. Two rules that
make the earlier draft statistically coherent:

- **Gates are on confidence bounds, not point estimates.** Precision passes only if its **one-sided 95%
  lower bound** meets the threshold; an error rate passes only if its **one-sided 95% upper bound** is below
  it. (99/100 correct does *not* pass a 99% gate.)
- **Sample size is power-derived per independently-gated population, not fixed.** With zero observed errors
  the one-sided 95% upper bound ≈ 3/n, so certifying an error rate `p` needs ≈ `3/p` **determinate**
  observations — ~**299** for a 99% precision lower bound, ~**598** for a 0.5% upper bound; at 70–80%
  coverage, ~430–855 sampled. A fixed n≈100 is for **descriptive** strata only, never for certifying 0.5%.

### Tiered by consequence (matches the staged rollout: research < beta < public)

The full statistical **certification** is the bar for **production / public exposure** (Track B, or any
public use of the identity layer). The **Track-A internal cutover** — reversible by version selection, no
public exposure, replacing a legacy layer never certified to any bound — uses a proportionate gate: it must
be **no worse than the incumbent and carry no observed severe error**, not independently certify 0.5%.

**Track-A internal-cutover gate (feasible now):**
- **Severe-error veto:** *any* adjudicated **severe** false merge (defined below) fails the candidate.
- **Relative gate — a paired noninferiority test, not a point comparison.** Loss, with the deployment mix
  **explicit**:
  \[ L = 5\,w_M\,FM_{\text{cond}} + w_S\,FS_{\text{cond}} \]
  where `FM_cond` = false-merge rate **among merge decisions**, `FS_cond` = false-split rate **among split
  decisions**, and `w_M, w_S` are the **preregistered deployment proportions** of merge vs. split decisions
  (`w_M + w_S = 1`) — so the adversarially-oversampled strata are reweighted to deployment prevalence and
  the two conditional rates combine on a common per-decision scale. *(Equivalently, define `FM = w_M·FM_cond`
  and `FS = w_S·FS_cond` as unconditional per-decision error contributions and write `L = 5·FM + FS`.)*
  Both systems are scored on the **same adjudicated items** (paired), determinate-only for the primary
  estimate. The gate: the **one-sided 95% upper bound of the paired difference `L(v2) − L(legacy)`**
  (paired bootstrap over adjudicated items, respecting strata) must be **≤ the preregistered margin
  `δ = 0.01`**. (`δ = 0` is strict noninferiority and may exceed the feasible sample.)
- **Descriptive, honestly bounded:** report every metric with its named-method one-sided 95% bound **and**
  a sensitivity pair — best case and **worst case (every `INDETERMINATE` counted as an error)** — plus
  coverage and indeterminacy reasons by mechanism and stratum.
- Feasible sample: the ~530-pair eval frame + a component-sampled identity set — enough for the paired
  noninferiority comparison and descriptive bounds, not for independently certifying 0.5%.

**Production / public-exposure certification (deferred):**

| Gate | Rule |
|---|---|
| Deterministic pairwise precision — **each mechanism gated independently** (`curated`, `registered-llc-id`) | per-mechanism one-sided 95% **lower** bound **≥ 99%** (no pooling — a high-volume mechanism must not mask a weak one) |
| Probabilistic pairwise precision — **each independently** (`registered-llc-name`, `fellegi-sunter`) | per-mechanism one-sided 95% **lower** bound **≥ 95%** |
| Component false-merge rate | one-sided 95% **upper** bound **≤ 2%** |
| Severe false merge | any observed case **vetoes**; pooled deployment-weighted **upper** bound **≤ 0.5%** before production |
| Coverage | **≥ 80% overall and per gated mechanism**; ≤80% (down to 70%) only for explicitly-labeled exploratory strata, which are then inconclusive + reported with the worst-case bound |
| Sample size | **power-derived** per independently-gated population (planning approx `≈3/p` → ~299/~598 determinate; ~430–855 sampled). If a mechanism's **total population is smaller** than the required n, **census it** (adjudicate all) rather than declaring it uncertifiable |
| Protected strata | report all. A stratum with an **adequate determinate sample must meet the 2% upper-bound gate**; one **without is reported underpowered/inconclusive and receives no independent assurance** — it does **not** get a fabricated ≤2% claim |
| Underpowered protected stratum → consequence | **blocks production of the affected mechanism/use case** (a high-risk stratum may not "launch anyway"); it may launch only under an explicitly restricted consequence tier. *(Track-A internal cutover: reported inconclusive, **not** a blocker — the severe-veto + reversibility bound the risk; production is where it blocks.)* |
| False splits | secondary constraint via the weighted loss `L` (paired noninferiority, above) |
| Failure | no cutover; correct/remove the mechanism, **freeze a new candidate version**, evaluate on fresh or sequestered data |

**Confidence-interval method (fixed, estimator-specific — Clopper–Pearson is *not* universal):**
- **Per-mechanism precision / error gates** (unweighted binomial from an applicable random sample):
  one-sided **Clopper–Pearson (exact)**.
- **Deployment-weighted / stratified / pooled rates** (e.g. the pooled severe-merge upper bound): a
  **preregistered stratified survey estimator** or an appropriately **stratum-resampled bootstrap** — not
  Clopper–Pearson.
- **Track-A loss difference `L(v2)−L(legacy)`**: the **paired bootstrap** (above), respecting strata.
- **Census** (entire mechanism population adjudicated): report the **finite-population** result directly —
  no sampling interval — while still reporting **adjudicator uncertainty** separately.
- Wilson is descriptive-only; the `≈3/p` rule is **planning only** (the gate is the exact/estimator bound on
  observed data). Fix the estimator per quantity and use it consistently across mechanisms and reruns.

### Definitions (fixed here)

- **Severe false merge (consequence-based, not just "distinct parties fused"):** a false merge that
  implicates a **living person**, **bridges components above a declared combined size** (`[RATIFY] T = 25`),
  transfers allegations/enforcement statistics, or connects otherwise-unrelated portfolios through a
  high-impact party. Track A exposes no allegations/public results, so its severe class is the **intrinsic**
  identity kind (living-person / large-bridge); downstream **publication** harm is a Track-B gate.
- **Component false-merge rate denominator:** *number of adjudicated multi-member components containing ≥1
  false merge ÷ number of adjudicated multi-member components.* **Sample components directly**, stratified
  by size and bridge-dependence (pair sampling under-detects one bad member in a large component). An
  `INDETERMINATE` member makes the component `INDETERMINATE` (excluded), and is also reported under the
  worst-case (member-is-error) bound.
- **C0 (Level-0) collisions use a different unit:** sample **sets of contributing source rows within one
  `party_reference`** (not party-reference pairs — the collision is *inside* a reference, pre-resolution).
  Report the collision rate among multi-row party references, the % showing evidence of >1 real party, and
  the buildings/records affected. The severe-error veto applies to C0 too (it is an irreversible
  pre-resolution identity operation).

The main §8 head-to-head rules carry `[RATIFY]` proposals frozen the same way: false-merge S4 `[bar]`,
severe-attribution stopping `[rate]`, bridge size `[T] = 25`.

## 9. Cluster-level validity & ablation

Pairwise precision (§5) is necessary but not sufficient: a good edge rate can still produce bad
clusters (one false bridge merges two valid groups). On the anchor portfolios (where a gold cluster
exists), also report:

- **Cluster metrics:** false-merge / false-split rate, **B³ purity & completeness**, and the max and
  distribution of cluster error (not just the mean).
- **Bridge sensitivity:** recompute clusters after removing each single inferred edge; a group that
  collapses when one edge is dropped is a bridge-risk flag. Report **direct-evidence** membership
  separately from **transitive** membership.
- **Ablation (isolates the common-control layer's marginal value):** score four configurations on the
  same items — (a) WoW, (b) sourced records only, (c) + registration network, (d) + both. If (d) does
  not beat (c)/(b) on the task metrics, the common-control layer is not earning its complexity.
- **Adversarial strata (extends §2):** the sample must over-include the dangerous cases random sampling
  misses — common surnames, shared professional/office addresses, relatives, large managers, reused LLC
  addresses, high-degree nodes.

## 10. Deliverables

1. Head-to-head metrics table (per stratum + WoW comparison, CIs, McNemar *p*) — precision **strict
   and inclusive**, with the **C2 share** per stratum.
2. κ and coverage / indeterminate rate.
3. Error-taxonomy breakdown (counts by cause).
4. **Released benchmark:** anonymization-reviewed pairs + gold labels + evidence tiers + rationales
   + this codebook — a reusable ground-truth set (a resource contribution in its own right).

**Notes on credibility.** Reporting an indeterminate rate and a data-vintage split reads as rigor,
not weakness — everyone in this domain knows ownership hides. A JustFix collaborator as
co-adjudicator materially raises trust in the gold set and neutralizes the "who says you're right"
objection.
